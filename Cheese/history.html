<h2>The History of Cheese</h2>
    <p>Cheese is an ancient food whose origins predate recorded history.
        There is no conclusive evidence indicating where cheesemaking originated,
        whether in Europe, Central Asia or the Middle East, but the practice had
        spread within Europe prior to Roman times and, according to Pliny the Elder,
        had become a sophisticated enterprise by the time the Roman Empire came into
        being.<br/><br/>

        Earliest proposed dates for the origin of cheesemaking range from around
        8000 BCE, when sheep were first domesticated. Since animal skins and inflated
        organs have, since ancient times, provided storage vessels for a range of
        foodstuffs, it is probable that the process of cheese making was discovered
        accidentally by storing milk in a container made from the stomach of an animal,
        resulting in the milk being turned to curd and whey by the rennet
        from the stomach.[citation needed]
        There is a legend—with variations—about the discovery of cheese by
        an Arab trader who used this method of storing milk. </p>
